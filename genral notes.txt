see, jab hum kisi folder ke andar folder banate hai and wo internal folder empty hota hai to git usse track nhi krta cuz wo empty hai 
and git files track krta hai wheather they are empty or not wo empty folder ko bydefault track nhi krta, but hume humara workflow
theek rakhne ke liye wo file chaiye bhi hoti hai isliye hum .gitkeep use krte hai to tell git isse bhi track karo

we also have git ignore file generator on internet which gives us bydefault all the files that should be in gitignore for that perticular project

we have created .env.sample so that in future i can know what were the things written in .env basically it is a copy of .env 

we are using module js and for module js we use import not required so we need to put this in package.json

now as we'll be adding multiple files in our project and we will need to restart our server often so for that we can either do manual start 
stop or we can use nodemon, nodemon basically restarts the server everytime the new file is saved
nodemon is a devdependency, now whats the diff in dependency and devdependency
dependency are those which are used in development phase as well as production phase, but devdependency are thode dependencies that
are not used in production, it is just used for development purpose  "npm i -D nodemon" command for installing nodemon devdependency

now our nodemon will reload the files in our index.js , but we need to define it like that
like we use 'npm run start' this command runs start from the package.json we will change it to dev and will define it
"dev": "nodemon src/index.js"  // when we will run "npm run dev"  nodemon will automatically run index.js 

thers also a slight issue with .env and module js that is we cannot use import 'dotenv/config' we need to use required for this one 
but we'll solve this issue later

now we have created multiple folders using mkdir command, and the folders that we created are contollers, db, models, middlewares, routes, utils
contollers is used for writting the contoller codes, db is used for writting the database connectivity, models is made for writting models of 
mongo in it, routes is made for writting apis in it /ig, /start ,/login etc, utils is for diff utilities like mailing, file uploading which we
will need multiple times

now we will also install prettier which is a devdependency and is mostly used for avoiding merge conflicts as it bydefaultly makes the code 
more organised. "npm i -D prettier", when the prettier is added we need to add some files (.prettierrc, .prettierignore) by our own to define what changes should be done 
automatically , .prettierignore is used to define which files are not meant to be changed like node modules, env files, distribution files etc

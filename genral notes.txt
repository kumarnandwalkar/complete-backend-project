see, jab hum kisi folder ke andar folder banate hai and wo internal folder empty hota hai to git usse track nhi krta cuz wo empty hai
but hume humara workflow theek rakhne ke liye wo file chaiye bhi hoti hai isliye hum .gitkeep use krte hai to tell git isse bhi track karo

we also have git ignore file generator on internet which gives us bydefault all the files that should be in gitignore for that perticular project

we have created .env.sample so that in future i can know what were the things written in .env basically it is a copy of .env 

we are using module js and for module js we use import not required so we need to put this in package.json

now as we'll be adding multiple files in our project and we will need to restart our server often so for that we can either do manual start 
stop or we can use nodemon, nodemon basically restarts the server everytime the new file is saved
nodemon is a devdependency, now whats the diff in dependency and devdependency
dependency are those which are used in development phase as well as production phase, but devdependency are thode dependencies that
are not used in production, it is just used for development purpose  "npm i -D nodemon" command for installing nodemon devdependency

now our nodemon will reload the files in our index.js , but we need to define it like that
like we use 'npm run start' this command runs start from the package.json we will change it to dev and will define it
"dev": "nodemon src/index.js"  // when we will run "npm run dev"  nodemon will automatically run index.js 

thers also a slight issue with .env and module js that is we cannot use import 'dotenv/config' we need to use required for this one 
but we'll solve this issue later
